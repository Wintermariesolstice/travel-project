            <h3>Singapore the Green city</h3>
            <p>
              The legend of Singapore is about how Sang Nila Utama founded the city of Singapura, or "Lion City".
              When, a storm appeared out of nowhere and nearly capsized the his boat. 
              In a desperate attempt, Sang Nila Utama threw his crown into the turbulent waters. 
              The weather and the sea immediately became calm, and the crew reached Teluk Belanga (present-day Telok Blangah) safely. 
              As they landed, a strange beast was spotted from afar. 
              Upon hearing that it was a lion, an auspicious symbol, Sang Nila Utama was overjoyed and decided to name the island Singapura, or Lion City.
              The discovery was said to have happened in around AD1297, and Sang Nila Utama went on to rule Singapura for 48 years before his death. 
              His palace and burial ground was located on top of Bukit Larangan, or Forbidden Hill (present-day Fort Canning Hill). 
              The story is told in the Malay Annals, one of the oldest surviving texts about Singapore's history.

              Singapore is known as a green city because of its many green spaces, sustainable buildings, and clean energy.
              As Singapore’s population and economy grew, so did its green cover: it was about 36% in the 1980s and it now stands at 47%, according to the Center for Liveable cities. 
              And while the word “green” can take on a variety of connotations, Singapore appears to encompass them all – lush environments, renewable energy and future sustainability.
              Singapore is also known as a food lover's paradise, where the vibrant street food scene is an essential part of the culture. 
              Residents eat out an average of four times a week, with loyal favorites scattered throughout the city.
